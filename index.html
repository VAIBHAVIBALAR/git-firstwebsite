            <a href="blogpost.html" ><h3>Pursed-lip breathing</h3></a>
            <span>Pursed-lip breathing is a simple technique which consists of inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth with pursued lips. A patient is instructed to inhale through the nose for several seconds with the mouth closed and then exhale slowly over 4 to 6 seconds through lips held in a whistling or kissing position. This can be done with or without abdominal muscle contraction-Ellen Hillegass. Essentials of Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy. 4th edition. Elsevier. 2017</span>

            <a href="blogpost.html" ><h3>Humming</h3></a>
            <span>Humming while exhaling helps increase nitric oxide production in the body. Nitric oxide helps with neural plasticity (building and repair of the nervous system) and it dilates blood vessels, enabling more oxygen to be delivered throughout the body. Humming is also calming and soothing, it reduces stress and it can help the patient remain in restoration mode.</span>
